    "title": "Why is Mondo Duplantis the Best Pole Vaulter in the World?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Who is Armand ‘Mondo’ Duplantis?\nMondo Duplantis is a Swedish-American pole vaulter who has taken the sport to new heights, constantly raising the bar and breaking his world records again and again. He began his vaulting career at the young age of four. Mondo’s father, Greg Duplantis, was an All-American pole vaulter at LSU and sparked Mondo’s passion at a very young age. His remarkable charted progression goes back to when he was six years old. There is no other vaulter in the world that has a record this detailed. \nLet’s break down what makes Mondo the best pole vaulter in the world.\nAs the saying goes, practice makes perfect. That’s exactly what has helped contribute to Mondo’s success. Since he started at such a young age, he had nearly ten more years of practice and experience than his peers. In his freshman year of high school, he was already jumping 4.87m (16’). With this impressive mark, he ultimately had no competition that could even touch the bars he was jumping at. \nHis career continued to take off after high school as he broke the 6-meter barrier (a huge accomplishment for any male vaulter) in his first (and only) year of college at his father’s alma mater LSU. \nAfter finishing his first year at LSU he decided to go pro and has flourished. He broke the world record in his rookie year.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\n\nMondo &lt;- read_csv(\"Mondo2020.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Name = \"Mondo Duplantis\") |&gt; \n  select(Name, Date, Competition, Result, Place) \n\nErnest &lt;- read_csv(\"ErnerstJohn.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Name = \"Ernest John Obiena\") |&gt; \n  select(Name, Date, Competition, Result, Place) \n\nChris &lt;- read_csv(\"ChrisNilsen2020.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Name = \"Chris Nilsen \") |&gt; \n  select(Name, Date, Competition, Result, Place) \n\nKurtis &lt;- read_csv(\"KurtisMarschall2020.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Name = \"Kurtis Marschall\") |&gt; \n  select(Name, Date, Competition, Result, Place) \n\nSam &lt;- read_csv(\"SamKendricks2020.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Name = \"Sam Kendricks\") |&gt; \n  select(Name, Date, Competition, Result, Place) \n\nKC &lt;- read_csv(\"KCLightfoot2020.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Name = \"KC Lightfoot\") |&gt; \n  select(Name, Date, Competition, Result, Place) \n\nThibaut &lt;- read_csv(\"ThibautCollet2020.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Name = \"Thibaut Collet\") |&gt; \n  select(Name, Date, Competition, Result, Place) \n\nBen &lt;- read_csv(\"BenBroeders2020.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Name = \"Ben Broeders\") |&gt; \n  select(Name, Date, Competition, Result, Place) \n\nPiotr &lt;- read_csv(\"PiotrLisek2020.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Name = \"Piotr Lisek\") |&gt; \n  select(Name, Date, Competition, Result, Place) \n\nBo &lt;- read_csv(\"BoKanda2020.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Name = \"Bo Kanda Lita Baehre\") |&gt; \n  select(Name, Date, Competition, Result, Place) \n\nMondoProg &lt;- read_csv(\"MondoProg.csv\") |&gt;\n separate(Height, into=c(\"Meters\", \"Feet\"), sep=\"\\\\|\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Meters = as.numeric(Meters))\n\nggplot() + geom_line(data=MondoProg, aes(x=Date, y=Meters, group=Athlete ), color=\"darkblue\") +\n  geom_rect(aes(xmin=as.Date(\"2014-08-01\"), xmax=as.Date(\"2006-08-12\"), ymin=0, ymax=7), fill=\"lightblue\", alpha=.2) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=as.Date(\"2018-01-01\"), y=4.5, label=\"Mondo breaks the \\n 6 meter barrier.\"), color=\"darkred\", size= 2.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=as.Date(\"2022-01-01\"), y=3.5, label=\"Mondo breaks the \\n pole vault world record.\"), color=\"maroon\", size= 2.5) +\n    geom_vline(xintercept=as.Date(\"2019-05-09\"), color=\"darkred\") + \n    geom_vline(xintercept=as.Date(\"2020-02-08\"), color=\"maroon\") + \n  labs(title = \"Soaring to Great Heights: Mondo Duplantis' Remarkable Pole Vault Journey\", \n    subtitle =\"Mondo's career highlighted by three distinct eras: pre-high school (light blue box), the 6 meter barrier, and breaking the world record.\", \n    y=\"Height in Meters\", \n    x=\"\",\n    caption=\"Source: World Athletics | By: Hannah Preissler\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=9), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the sheer amount of time that he has had to develop as a pole vaulter, is very important when looking at what makes Mondo the best pole vaulter in the world.\n\nWith the Olympics being in 2020, (Technically completed in 2021 due to COVID-19) this is a good season to compare Mondo’s stats to his competitors. Among the other top ten pro vaulters in the world, Mondo averaged the highest bars cleared, averaged the best place finishes, and competed in the third most meets. He is by far, the most consistent vaulter which allows him to succeed on the runway.\n\n\nCode\nmerged2020 &lt;- bind_rows(Mondo, Ben, Bo, Chris, Ernest, KC, Kurtis, Piotr, Sam, Thibaut)\n\ncompetitionresults &lt;- merged2020 |&gt; \n  group_by(Name) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    Competitions = n(),\n    AvgResult = mean(Result),\n    AvgPlace = mean(Place))\n\nmondocomps &lt;- competitionresults |&gt; \n  filter(Name == \"Mondo Duplantis\")\nchriscomps &lt;- competitionresults |&gt;\n  filter(str_trim(Name) == \"Chris Nilsen\")\nernestcomps &lt;- competitionresults |&gt;\n  filter(Name == \"Ernest John Obiena\")\nkccomps &lt;- competitionresults |&gt;\n  filter(Name== \"KC Lightfoot\")\n                      \nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=competitionresults,aes(x=AvgPlace, y=AvgResult, size= Competitions), color=\"lightgrey\")+\n  geom_point(data=mondocomps, aes(x=AvgPlace, y=AvgResult, size= Competitions), color=\"maroon\")+\n  geom_point(data=ernestcomps, aes(x=AvgPlace, y=AvgResult, size= Competitions), color=\"lightblue\")+\n   geom_point(data=chriscomps, aes(x=AvgPlace, y=AvgResult, size= Competitions), color=\"darkblue\")+\n  geom_text_repel(data=mondocomps, aes(x=AvgPlace, y=AvgResult, label=Name), size = 3) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=chriscomps, aes(x=AvgPlace, y=AvgResult, label=Name), size = 3) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=ernestcomps, aes(x=AvgPlace, y=AvgResult, label=Name), size = 3) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=kccomps, aes(x=AvgPlace, y=AvgResult, label=Name), size = 3) +\n    labs(title = \"Top 10 Pro Pole Vaulters: A Spotlight on 2020 Season Achievements\", \n    subtitle =\"Mondo is constantly winning meets and jumping the highest against top performers repeatedly.\", \n    y=\"Height (Meters)\", \n    x=\"Aveage Placing at Competitions\",\n    caption=\"Source: World Athletics | By: Hannah Preissler\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=9), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final component that contributes to Mondo being the most dominant pole vaulter is his ability to break the world record… more than once.\nThe world record data dates back to 1912 and has been pushed higher and higher throughout the years while being passed from athlete to athlete with two standing out among the others.\nSergey Bubka is a former Ukrainian pole vaulter who pioneered the sport. Many vaulters look to him as the picture of technique when it comes to vaulting. Sergey first broke the world record in 1984 clearing 5.94 m (19’5”). He continued to break his world record sixteen more times over his career clearing 6.14 m (20’1”). Sergey’s world record reign is highlighted by the maroon lines.\nMondo took off right where Sergey left off. Again, in his rookie year, he broke the world record by clearing 6.17 m (20’2”). He has continued to break this record six times since 2020. Mondo’s world records are highlighted by the dark blue lines.\n\n\nCode\nworldrecord &lt;- read_csv(\"WorldRecords.csv\") |&gt;\n  separate(Mark, into=c(\"Meters\", \"Feet\"), sep=\"\\\\(\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Meters = as.numeric(gsub(\" m\",\"\", Meters)))\n\n\nsergeywr &lt;- worldrecord |&gt; \n  filter(Athlete == \"Sergey Bubka\")\nmondowr &lt;- worldrecord |&gt;\n  filter(Athlete == \"Armand Duplantis\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_lollipop(data=worldrecord, aes(y=Meters, x=Date), horizontal = FALSE, color =\"grey\")+\n  geom_lollipop(data=sergeywr, aes(y=Meters, x=Date), horizontal = FALSE, color=\"maroon\")+\n  geom_lollipop(data=mondowr, aes(y=Meters, x=Date), horizontal = FALSE, color=\"darkblue\")+\n  geom_text(aes(x=as.Date(\"2001-05-01\"), y=4.5, label=\"Sergey Bubka\"), color=\"maroon\", size= 2.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=as.Date(\"2011-05-01\"), y=3.5, label=\"Mondo Duplantis\"), color=\"darkblue\", size= 2.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Exploring the Progression of the Pole Vault World Record Holders\", \n    subtitle =\"Sergey Bubka and Mondo Duplantis have broken the WR the most times of anyone.\", \n    y=\"Height (Meters)\", \n    x=\"\",\n    caption=\"Source: World Athletics | By: Hannah Preissler\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=9), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nMondo’s impressive pole vault career is far from over, making him the current best pole vaulter in the world. Will the rest of his career write him the title of being the all-time best pole vaulter in the world?"

Because the Huskers can create a gap between their opponents, Nebraska has more opportunities to score on other teams.\nWhen it comes to hitting, where are the Huskers ranked? Taking a closer look at kills per set and team kills, can bring clarity to Nebraska’s offensive efficiency\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=offense, aes(x=Kills, y=`Per Set`), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=joined_top15, aes(x=Kills, y=`Per Set`), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=nu, aes(x=Kills, y=`Per Set`), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=nu, aes(x=Kills, y=`Per Set`, label=Team), size = 4) +\n  labs(x=\"Team Kills\",\n       y=\"Kills Per Set\", \n       title=\"Nebraska’s Offensive Efficiency Stands Out Among Top Contenders\", \n       subtitle=\"The Huskers kills per set and total team kills are two factors contributing to their success.\", \n       caption=\"Source: NCCA.com | By Hannah Preissler\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Huskers are in the upper quartile for kills per set and are towards the middle of the pack when it comes to total team kills.\nWhat exactly does this mean for Nebraska’s offense?\nThe Huskers sweep most of their opponents therefore they are playing less sets resulting in less opportunities to rack up kills compared to teams who are regularly playing five sets.\nLooking defensively, is Nebraska just as strong as they are offensively?\nBlocking and digging are two stats that can show where teams are defensively. Nebraska is in the middle of the pack when looking at the top 25 teams.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=dbell, aes(x=reorder(Team, PerSet), weight=PerSet, fill=Type)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"navy\", \"darkgrey\")) + \n  coord_flip() +\n   labs(\n     title = \"Nebraska Falls to the Middle of the Pack Defensively\", \n     subtitle =\"Something else is contributing to the Huskers' success other than blocks and digs.\", \n     y=\"\", \n     x=\"\",\n     caption=\"Source: NCAA.com | By Hannah Preissler\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nThinking back to Nebraska’s opponent hitting percentage, it is obvious why the Husker’s blocks per set offset their digs per set. Being proficient in blocking gives Nebraska less room to dig the ball.\nIn summary, Nebraska’s volleyball success in the 2023 season is a result of a well-rounded performance, with a balanced emphasis on offense and defense. While they may not lead in hitting percentage, their strategic approach to keeping opponents’ hitting percentage low has proven effective. The Huskers excel in kills per set, proving their offensive effectiveness, and their defensive capabilities, seen in blocks per set, play a crucial role in maintaining their opponents’ hitting percentages.\nThis dynamic strategy allows Nebraska to dominate in matches, often sweeping opponents and limiting their opportunities to accumulate kills. As the No. 1 ranked team with an undefeated record, the Huskers’ success lies in the cohesion of their offensive and defensive strategies, making them an intimidating force in collegiate volleyball."
