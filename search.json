    "text": "Nebraska volleyball has had a rich history over the last decade. It's no surprise that the Huskers are keeping traditions alive through the 2023 season. They are the  No. 1 ranked team in the nation and are the only undefeated team going into their last five regular season games.\n\nThe Huskers are proving that they are one of the best teams that Nebraska has seen recently. \nWhy is this?\nThis raises the question, is Nebraska's success attributed to their offensive or defensive power?\nA closer look into key statistics such as hitting percentage and opponent hitting percentage provides insight into a team's overall efficiency. The Huskers hit .288 against their opponents while keeping their opponents at an impressive .135. Here's a glimpse at the top 25 ranked teams and their overall efficiency. \n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\ntop25 &lt;- c(\"Nebraska\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Louisville\", \"Texas\", \"Stanford\", \"Pittsburgh\", \"Oregon\", \"Arkansas\", \"Washington St.\", \"Georgia Tech\", \"Tennessee\", \"BYU\", \"Kentucky\", \"Kansas\", \"Arizona St.\", \"Creighton\", \"Purdue\", \"Dayton\", \"Penn St.\", \"Baylor\", \"Florida\", \"Houston\", \"Western Ky.\", \"Auburn\", \"Southern California\")\n\nhittingpct &lt;- read_csv(\"newhitting.csv\") |&gt;

Because the Huskers can create a gap between their opponents, Nebraska has more opportunities to score on other teams.\nWhen it comes to hitting, where are the Huskers ranked? Taking a closer look at kills per set and team kills, can bring clarity to Nebraska’s offensive efficiency\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=offense, aes(x=Kills, y=`Per Set`), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=joined_top15, aes(x=Kills, y=`Per Set`), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=nu, aes(x=Kills, y=`Per Set`), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=nu, aes(x=Kills, y=`Per Set`, label=Team), size = 4) +\n  labs(x=\"Team Kills\",\n       y=\"Kills Per Set\", \n       title=\"Nebraska’s Offensive Efficiency Stands Out Among Top Contenders\", \n       subtitle=\"The Huskers kills per set and total team kills are two factors contributing to their success.\", \n       caption=\"Source: NCCA.com | By Hannah Preissler\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Huskers are in the upper quartile for kills per set and are towards the middle of the pack when it comes to total team kills.\nWhat exactly does this mean for Nebraska’s offense?\nThe Huskers sweep most of their opponents therefore they are playing less sets resulting in less opportunities to rack up kills compared to teams who are regularly playing five sets.\nLooking defensively, is Nebraska just as strong as they are offensively?\nBlocking and digging are two stats that can show where teams are defensively. Nebraska is in the middle of the pack when looking at the top 25 teams.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=dbell, aes(x=reorder(Team, PerSet), weight=PerSet, fill=Type)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"navy\", \"darkgrey\")) + \n  coord_flip() +\n   labs(\n     title = \"Nebraska Falls to the Middle of the Pack Defensively\", \n     subtitle =\"Something else is contributing to the Huskers' success other than blocks and digs.\", \n     y=\"\", \n     x=\"\",\n     caption=\"Source: NCAA.com | By Hannah Preissler\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nThinking back to Nebraska’s opponent hitting percentage, it is obvious why the Husker’s blocks per set offset their digs per set. Being proficient in blocking gives Nebraska less room to dig the ball.\nIn summary, Nebraska’s volleyball success in the 2023 season is a result of a well-rounded performance, with a balanced emphasis on offense and defense. While they may not lead in hitting percentage, their strategic approach to keeping opponents’ hitting percentage low has proven effective. The Huskers excel in kills per set, proving their offensive effectiveness, and their defensive capabilities, seen in blocks per set, play a crucial role in maintaining their opponents’ hitting percentages.\nThis dynamic strategy allows Nebraska to dominate in matches, often sweeping opponents and limiting their opportunities to accumulate kills. As the No. 1 ranked team with an undefeated record, the Huskers’ success lies in the cohesion of their offensive and defensive strategies, making them an intimidating force in collegiate volleyball."
